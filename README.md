# MoErgo Glove80 Custom Configuration for ZMK

![MoErgo Logo](moergo_logo.png)

I have used the emacs org to compose literal configurations. The primary advantage is that the keymap can be conveniently indented using an org table. Afterwards, I employ `org-babel-tangle` to produce `glove80.c`. Therefore, please refer to [glove80.org](glove80.org) for my configuration details.
